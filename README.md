## Introduction:
The restaurant industry is highly competitive, and it is important to uderstand what drives customer satisfaction in order to make informed business decisions. 
This project uses the Restaurant Ratings Mexico 2012 dataset to analyze consumer preferences, restaurant performance, and market gaps. By studying both ratings and demand–supply dynamics, the goal is to uncover patterns that explain why certain restaurants succeed, which cuisines are most preferred, and where opportunities exist for new entrants.

## Key Metrics:

- Which restaurants have the highest overall, food, and service ratings?
- What are the top cuisines preferred by consumers?
- How do consumer preferences compare to restaurant supply?
- What can we learn from the characteristics of consumers (age, marital status, occupation, budget)?
- Do consumer preferences influence restaurant ratings?

## Skills Demonstrated:

The following Power BI features were incorporated
- Data Importing
- Data Cleaning
- Data Modelling
- DAX Calculations
- Data Visualization
- Dashboard Automation

### Analysis:

### Insights from the Highest-Rated Restaurants

The top-rated restaurants are those that consistently achieve Highly Satisfactory (rating = 2) scores in food and service. These qualities strongly influence overall ratings, showing that consumers value not just the cuisine itself, but also the experience delivered.

### Consumer Demographics and Bias

The consumer base is dominated by young, single students with medium-to-low budgets. This indicates a bias in the dataset toward younger, budget-conscious individuals, while older, married, and higher-income groups are underrepresented. As a result, restaurant strategies should focus on affordability and appeal to youth preferences.

### Demand and Supply Gaps

A clear demand–supply gap exists in the market. Mexican cuisine shows the highest consumer demand but is underserved by restaurants, making it the strongest investment opportunity. American cuisine shows moderate demand with some gap, while other cuisines (Italian, Cafeteria, Pizzeria, etc.) have limited demand and are niche markets.

### Investment Characteristics

If I were to invest in a restaurant, I would focus on the following characteristics:
- Cuisine Type: Mexican (highest demand, limited supply).
- Budget Level: Medium (matches majority of consumers).
- Target Market: Young, single students.
- Quality Standard: Must achieve Highly Satisfactory (rating = 2) in both food and service.
- Service Focus: Strong emphasis on food quality and customer service.
- Location: Urban/student-heavy areas to align with consumer demographics.

## Final Recommendation:
An investor should open a medium-budget Mexican restaurant that delivers consistently high food and service quality, targeting young students in urban areas. This aligns directly with consumer demand, demographics, and proven success factors from the dataset.
